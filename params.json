This page is like a public card... but a kind of cool one (where \"cool\" means \"nerdy\" and \"kind of\" means \"very\"). You can use it to post your CV, cool projects, pictures of cute baby animals. Oh my! It even is multilingual. Por ejemplo, se puede escribir en espanol, Evita. Or, ë³€.\r\n\r\n### Now, a joke\r\nWhat do you call a fish with no eyes?\r\nAnswer: \"fssssshhhh\".\r\n\r\n### Help\r\nNeed help updating this? I think I know someone who can help. Or, at least find pictures of baby animals.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
